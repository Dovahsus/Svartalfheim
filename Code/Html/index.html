    <h1>Automobili Lamborghini</h1>
    <p>
      Estabished in 1963 by Ferrucio Lamborghini in Santa Agata, Italy. The
      lamborghini name has since become a household name in the realm of
      motorsports, even with the lack of racing participation from the brand
      over the years. Lamborghini sought out to do one thing and one thing only
      and that was beat Ferrari, Which he did with the debut of his very first
      supercar, the 350-GT. Since then Ferrari has been chasing the greatness
      that Lamborghini so effortlessly holds.

    <h2>Ferrari Sucks. Lost to Ford</h2>
    <p>
      Enzo Ferrari was a proud dickhead who turned away genuine good advice from
      a man who at the time owned multiple editions of Ferrari's road car,
      Lamborghini went to Ferrari with a way to make the car drive better but
      Enzo shut him down, saying he was but a simple farmer and should stick to
      his tractors, this understandably upset Lamborghini and from that action,
      Automobili Lamborghini was born. instead of taking it into account he
      decided to build an entirely new car around it. This resulted in the V12
      engine powered Miura which quickly became known as the most beautiful car
      ever made. After this success Lamborghini continued on its path of
      innovation, building upon what had already proven itself to be successful.
      In 1984 Lamborghini introduced the Diablo, a car that would go down in
      history as one of the greatest sports cars of all time. It was fast,
      stylish and more than capable of keeping up with the likes of Porsche
      Carrera GT and BMW M3.

    <h4>Lamborghini Racing</h4>
    <p>
      In 1984, Lamborghini faced its biggest challenge yet when it lost the
      Formula One constructors' championship to none other than Ford Motor
      Company. This loss came as no surprise to anyone who had seen how well
      Lamborghini’s newest model performed on track. However, what made this
      defeat all the more bittersweet is that Lamborghini itself was not
      involved in the race at all. Instead, they handed their title to the
      Americans. It wasn’t until 1987 that Lamborghini returned to Formula One
      with the introduction of the V12 engine powered Modena. Although this car
      was not nearly as successful as its predecessor, it still managed to bring
      back some much needed pride for the Italian manufacturer.
